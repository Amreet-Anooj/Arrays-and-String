### Arrays in C++
An array is a data structure of elements with same data type stored at contiguous memory locations.

**Features :**
- Fixed size: The size of an array after being defined cannot be changed later.
- Contiguous memory allocation: All elements are stored in continuous memory blocks.
- Index-based: Array elements can be accessed using thier indices.

**Example:**
An array of 5 integers
```cpp
int a[5]; 
```
<br>


### Strings in C++
Strings are sequences of characters used to store text. In C++, the `string` class is defined in the ```<string>``` header file. There are two types of strings in C++ : <br>
1. C style Strings
2. std : : string

**Features:**
- Iteration: Strings support iterations for traversing thier contents.
- Concatenation: Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator.
- Indexing: Strings support indexing, allowing access to individual characters using the `[]` operator.
- Comparison: Strings can be compared using operators `(==, !=, <, >, etc.)`.
- Modification: Characters in a string can be modified through direct indexing.

**Example:**
An array of strings
```cpp
string str1 = "Hello"; 
```
